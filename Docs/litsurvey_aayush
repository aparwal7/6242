1. The Future of Spatial Analysis in the Social Sciences
Main Idea : The study mainly wants to address how advances in geo-spatial analysis is influenced by social sciences and vice versa.
This is useful as construction permits for residential, commercial or public buildings go hand in hand with socio-economic demography of an area.
Given the time, study cites major challenges in being able to read, manipulate and store large amounts of detailed data which is required for any geo-spatial analysis, like maps, roads etc. With today's accessibility of such data from local governments and combining it with flexibility of cloud, makes such limitations go away around gis.
	
2. Using Building Permits to Monitor Disaster Recovery: A Spatio-Temporal Case Study of Coastal Mississippi Following Hurricane Katrina
Main Idea : of the author here is to identify extent of damage and recovery efforts based on building permits and a spatial scan.
This is directly relevant to us as city planners, specifically in danger areas, can use our website/tool to balance giving out building permits to residential, and also understand disaster recovery clusters and allocate resources accordingly.
Author touches but fails to fully integrate re-population, or not immigration pre and post disaster. For example if people chose to move away from the region permanently.
	
3. Adaptive clustering algorithm based on kNN and density
Main idea: The author looks to utilize density of population to sample t dynamically adjust k value in the algorithm.
This is particularly useful for us as even within city concentration of building permits needs to be changed for example, city center vs suburbs etc.
Author fails to show how the cluster moves/trends as external factors influence density as against to a cluster behaving in a silo. Our analysis using the building permits will look to perform trend analysis on these clusters
