A1
Our aim is to build an interactive analytics portal to assess construction density trends in an urban area.

A2
Currently, 
1. We see static visualizations and don't find trend charts and geo-spatial analysis done together
2. Lot of focus is on residential and/or commercial real estate pricing, however our focus is to understand all types of building permits

A3
Our tool would offer,
1. Dynamic and Inteactive Geo-temporal analysis of construction in a city
2. Out of the box visualizations for unsophisticated users and also ability to create a custom view

A4
1. Real Estate Analysts - pricing depends on factors like train stations, shopping centers, schools and hospitals also in the area rather than just new homes.
2. City Planners - Understanding the construction density trend, city planners can make much more informed decision on where and by when to build more public infrastructure to support the population
3. Real Estate ( Buyers/Sellers ) - Get a hollistic view of upcoming development in an area to make a more informed decision
